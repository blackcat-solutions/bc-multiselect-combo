bc-multiselect-combo
=======================

A multi-select combo component which uses a dgrid to show the available options, providing type-ahead filtering
allowing for selection amongst large data sets as can be done for instance in MS Excel.

See [the test page](http://blackcatsolutions.co.uk/bc-components/bc-multiselect-combo/test/TestMultiSelectComboBox.html) for examples of how it can be configured for different use cases.

Limitations
===========
The component does not support external setting of the selection - selection is currently entirely self-contained.
